        <h2>Why I made this</h2>
        <p>Now, I do a lot of image, video editing, and website development, and getting png images online
            is something I do pretty much all the time. But there was something that always annoyed me
            when I'm searching for images online, and that's when the actual graphic or logo in the 
            png was way smaller than the size of the png itself.
            <br />
            <br />
            Why was this a problem? Well, whenever I wanted to put different png images together in a website
            I'm working on, some images end up looking smaller than the others because of the difference in how
            the graphics are sized in the png images.
            <br />
            <br />
            <img src="./images/Png problem showcase.PNG">
            <p><i>How it looked</i></p>
            <br />
            <br />
            So to fix this, I always had to go to photoshop, crop the png image, then save the newly cropped image.
            This was fine, but I wanted a faster way, so I can increase my workflow, then I made this.
            <br />
            <br />
            This made using an algorithm I wrote in javascript that checks each pixel in and image, and detects which pixels are
            transparent and which ones aren't.
            <br />
